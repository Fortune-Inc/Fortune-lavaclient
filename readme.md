A simple, easy-to-use, and flexible node.js lavalink client.

- **Plugins**: Provides a simple `Plugin` class that the Manager can load, you can view the [Plugins Guide](https://lavaclient.js.org/guide/plugins.html) for a basic implementation.
- **Easy-to-use**: LavaClient has a neat and user-friendly promise-based api.
- **Performant**: Designed to be small and performant, it's a great choice for any sized project.
